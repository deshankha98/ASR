# ASR
Automatic Speech Recognition

This project is an implementation of ASR using Wav2Vec2-base-960h for generation of labels' wise probability and applying a custom beam search on the probabilities across timesteps.
Wav2Vec2 is trained on CTC([Context Temporal Classification](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/)) and the beam search applied on the probability(log-prob) beam is a Guided beam search allowing at timestep **T** only the tokens allowed to succeed after the token at timestep **T-1**. See [GuidedBeamSearch.py](https://github.com/deshankha98/ASR/blob/main/beam_search/GuidedBeamSearch.py) for implementation details. The guided beam search maximizes the likelihood of the final sequence of tokens formed and preserves the state of the atmost top **N** beams at any timestep. Check [Wav2Vec2FinetunedPrediction.py](https://github.com/deshankha98/ASR/blob/main/finetuned_pred/Wav2Vec2FinetunedPrediction.py) for an example usage, and [date_word_vs_state.py](https://github.com/deshankha98/ASR/blob/main/beam_search/word_state_files/date_word_vs_state.py) for defining the state transitions. 
Please note that the [[pyctcdecode](https://github.com/kensho-technologies/pyctcdecode)] library provides enough use cases to perform the same tasks in an easier way for the user to implement. This implementation allows you to detect exact keywords/finite or infinite sequence of keywords by defining your own state transitions.
